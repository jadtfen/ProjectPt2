I managed to fix the search, add movies  and displaymovie. The vote page is now correctly connected but it is not displaying anything yet, but the movies are being added to the poll from the search page. The votepage is giving me a lot of trouble so it will take me a bit longer to fix. Also need to fix the members not being retrieved properly. I probably will pick it back up tomorrow because I'm pretty burnt out.
ja d tf en â€” 07/21/2024 7:23 PM
kk its okay im getting the email verificantion to work
ja d tf en â€” 07/22/2024 10:59 AM

Josaiah Saldana â€” 07/22/2024 1:19 PM
Yeah Iâ€™ll send it right now

ja d tf en â€” 07/22/2024 1:44 PM
you only edited the join create and vote page right?
Josaiah Saldana â€” 07/22/2024 1:52 PM
I think I also edited the search and home page
Just the api url if I remember correctly
ja d tf en â€” 07/22/2024 1:52 PM
yea my dumb ass had a https instead of http ðŸ˜­
i fixed that in some of them
as i went down iâ€™m almost home and iâ€™ll try those out bc thatâ€™s the only error i have now and then see how to vote page works more too by tonight
ja d tf en â€” 07/22/2024 4:52 PM
hey so I got everything to work except for the session id
im going to send you everything I have in like 2 hours I think I can get everything else fixed by the but the session id stuff isnt working for me i got the login to work with local storage for now i thyink it mightbe easier and the register page I was able to get the verification to work im at the search page now to fix that
Josaiah Saldana â€” 07/22/2024 5:30 PM
okay I'll take a look at it. By everything working, do you also mean the members being fetched properly at home and the vote page displaying the movies?
ja d tf en â€” 07/22/2024 5:31 PM
im working on that now I was able to get the user to work login registeration with verfication create a party join and now that im pass all of that im too the search page
Josaiah Saldana â€” 07/22/2024 6:23 PM
Alright. I am working on the votePage and it seems to retrieve the movies well now
Josaiah Saldana â€” 07/22/2024 9:32 PM
I got votePage to retrieve the movies successfully, even when the movies are added by search. Do you want me to send the files voer
ja d tf en â€” 07/22/2024 9:52 PM

uhh ill email you mine
ja d tf en â€” 07/23/2024 12:58 PM
maybe if you fix the api the same with what I have currently everything works I just have to change the backgrounf the only other thing is that its not letting more than one user use the code
lmk if you got them
Josaiah Saldana â€” 07/23/2024 1:27 PM
So just search page isnâ€™t working?
ja d tf en â€” 07/23/2024 1:31 PM

ja d tf en â€” 07/23/2024 2:57 PM
the group members and top pics on home page
Josaiah Saldana â€” 07/23/2024 4:35 PM
Could you push your current files into the github? I tried using it, but there are a lot of things that are not working at the moment.
ja d tf en â€” 07/23/2024 4:57 PM
i had to change it for heroku to a diff git repository 
so iâ€™m not sure if i can set it to another one with out disconnecting the ink
what was the issue with the ones i sent you?
Josaiah Saldana â€” 07/23/2024 5:00 PM
The login isnâ€™t working, userid isnâ€™t being found, a created party is going to the wrong place in the database, etc. Idk if it is because we are sending zips, but if this stuff is working on your end then that is fine.
ja d tf en â€” 07/23/2024 5:01 PM

im not sure if my api is connected wrong or
Image
so i found the error its the index.hmtl file
Josaiah Saldana â€” Today at 4:29 AM
is this file still using json web tokens?
ja d tf en â€” Today at 4:30 AM
yea i can fix that i opened an old project to see if it was something i was doing I can just insert the register page if I can get this all to run
its not hitting that error tho
its something with the index.html
Josaiah Saldana â€” Today at 4:32 AM
hmm it's just that I see that some of the api in that file are using authorization bearer tokens which we aren't creating anymore in the backend. I also stopped updating the api/auth/token as well because we no longer needed it. Out of curiosity, what does the api/auth/user do?
ja d tf en â€” Today at 4:33 AM
is this in the api endpoints?
or are you asking me to curl it?
Josaiah Saldana â€” Today at 4:35 AM
I am not sure what a curl is if I am being honest. The only api I am unware about is the api/auth/user
oh wait I might be going crazy. Are those tokens for the email portion?
the verification stuff?
ja d tf en â€” Today at 4:37 AM
i thought so? but i could be wrong
also that was for me to pull to display on the profile page
Josaiah Saldana â€” Today at 4:38 AM
ah alright gotcha
ja d tf en â€” Today at 4:38 AM
If your index.html is being served instead of the API responses, it typically means that your server is not correctly routing requests to the appropriate handlers.
so its a google issue...

Now that you mention it I have been testing this on firefox
wait nvm
ja d tf en â€” Today at 4:43 AM
did it work on fire fox?
Josaiah Saldana â€” Today at 4:46 AM
no it has actually begun to fail me right now
hold on let me see into it
ja d tf en â€” Today at 4:48 AM
maybe we should try changing the fetches to this like this perosn says?
Image
Josaiah Saldana â€” Today at 4:51 AM
Are you testing this on your frontend? And if so, could you check the developer tools
ja d tf en â€” Today at 4:51 AM
yeaa it still threw me the same thing
Josaiah Saldana â€” Today at 4:55 AM
you said that you have the frontend running on a domain? was it netlify?
ja d tf en â€” Today at 4:55 AM
yea
Josaiah Saldana â€” Today at 4:56 AM
could you send the url
ja d tf en â€” Today at 4:56 AM
i tried to but then the login page was being weird

okay i am going to make a push to the heroku main
ja d tf en â€” Today at 4:58 AM
okay
is it giving you errors?
Josaiah Saldana â€” Today at 5:06 AM
yeah I am having some merge conflicts with the server.js file. I am fixing it rn
ja d tf en â€” Today at 5:07 AM
kk i was making sure you didnt have the one i earlier
Josaiah Saldana â€” Today at 5:17 AM
honestly I'm kind of afraid to push anything right now if rachelle is using the backend and it's working.


In the server.js file

app.use(
  cors({
    origin: ['http://localhost:5002/', 'http://group5cop4331.com/'],
    credentials: true,
  })
);

This was the only change I was going to make. Just adding the frontend url into the cors
because it's giving me a lot of issues right now
ja d tf en â€” Today at 5:18 AM
yea i already had that changed to the server js already for the heroku
oh wait
I tried that with the url and the heroku link and im building that now

const handleResponse = async (response) => {
